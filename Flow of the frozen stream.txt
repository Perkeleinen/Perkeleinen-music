1. Flow of the frozen stream

I fell through the ice
What a treacherous stream
But i climbed up
No drowning for me
After discarding my soaking clothes
I managed to gather some wood for a fire
But with my frozen fingers
I was unable to light it
I gave up and looked up to see the stars
But only clouds filled the sky
And then a sudden flash and a thunderous roar

The fire starts raging
It fills my veins with warmth
Thoughts start to fly
And plans are being compared
No wood for the bonfire
Is seen for me to fetch
No knowledge of help
As it's first time for me here

The flames are fading 
And i realize that i must move
Naked in the darkness 
Wet clothes left behind
Small sliver of light as the clouds move
I see the moon and realize
There is smoke between me and the light
I start Running

Snow burns my feet
And breathing cuts my throat
After a while 
I feel it no more
Fallen to trance
I run to spare my life
Frost in my beard
Reminds me we all die

After what felt like ages i collapse
I see the warm light of fire 
But I'm too tired to continue
It's time to sleep
I take a final look at the sky 
And close my eyes

2. With it I'll Feel Content

It's all I want
Just one more thing
With it 
I'll feel content

New things for an innocent mind
Give so much joy and are so exiting
But there is only one first time
After some time you yearn for a change
After a taste the need just grows 
And you feel jealousy and envy

It's all I want
Just one more thing
With it 
I'll feel content

Where is the colour of life
Slaving away you're trying to reach it
You have much more than you dreamed of
Yet you feel empty and nothing feels good
Still you seek more and now you know
That there are ways to get it fast

I want it all
I need it all
Power, wealth, status, sex
Take them all for you

Cheat! Steal!
Abuse! Exploit!
Rape! Slave!
Kill! Enjoy!

Ruining their lives for a moment of joy
Filling your needs is the ultimate choice
All is yours 
Until you die
Take it all for you

It's all I want
Just one more thing
With it
I'll feel content

It's all I want
Just one more thing
With it
I'll feel content
