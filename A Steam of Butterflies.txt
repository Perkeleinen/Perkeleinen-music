1. A Stream Of Butterflies

I feel like
Trapped in my dreams
I see my own lies
They give me comfort
Until they break
Dear mind, watch over me

A worthless sack of meat
Thinks its worth is more than feed
Just end your life today
It is time to hang or maybe bleed
As you know, you are better as
A jar of ash or left to rot

There are times when I feel alright
Smoke and mirrors will not stay
Final freedom is calling me
It will set me free

A worthless sack of meat
Is now worth its weight as feed
Maggots feasting on their flesh
After a winter at same spot
A single flower sprouts from ground
Feeding a stream of butterflies

2. Spellsong

You make me feel
like magic is not real
You cloud every day
And interrupt my sleep

Good days we share are rare
That doesn't mean I chose your pain
The fact you still are here
Makes me think you will never leave

You make me feel
like magic is not real
You cloud every day
And interrupt my sleep

These days you annoy me
Shut your trap just let me be
The fact you still are here
Makes me think you will never learn

Tahdon tehdä taian tässä
Sillä sinut poistan täält
Murskaan myöskin muistot susta
Poistan tiedot tiedostoista

I will cast a spell by singing
It will make you disappear
Memories of you go missing
Files no longer mention you

I answer your summons
in exchange for souls i will consume
What you asked for
Shall all be done

You made me feel
like magic is not real
You cloud every day
And interrupt my sleep

I woke up rotting here
In deepest pit of freezing hell
The fact you are not here
Makes me think I should have cared

I answered your summons
In exchange for souls I consumed
What you asked for
Has all be done
