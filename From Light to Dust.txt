1. Dawn of life:

Ancient sphere
Made of flames
Has reached the end
It collapses
Exploding out
Shock wave of dust

Dust gathers
And forms a plate
It takes new shapes
They condense
And take their paths
Earth is born

Flames calm down
It starts to rain
Flooding the seas
In there
Carbonic chains
Form and survive

Combinations alternate but then
Acidic chains
Self replicate

Information is saved in base pairs
Random errors bring forth new structures
New formations that shape their placements
Random errors evolve new functions

Wait
It ate
It are me here I will stay
You keep me fed
I'll lend you all of my strength

It is time
to join with those who seem same
Forming a group
Can make us stronger today

It is time to rise from the seas!

Explosion like speed of the changes
Fills the land with life diverse in ranges
Combinations that fare
In fusing germlines to breed
Will make their mark in the gene pool

The Beauty
Of all this life
Is sight to see
Hairy shade
Falls down from tree
It's self aware

2. What makes me

My mind is taking in 
So much

I can see the world
In my dreams and when I'm up
How can i tell if its true or not

I see hear feel taste and smell
Sometimes these all can make me feel good
But there are things that make me feel pain
Often so hard it makes me stay away

What makes me feel 
All the things
That
I have felt

Pleasure and pain 
I'm learning things from them
They guide my actions now
But why i follow them

Chasing for pleasure can turn it into pain 
It took a while to realize  

I see hear feel taste and smell
Sometimes these all can make me feel good
But there are things that make me feel pain
Often so hard it makes me stay away

What makes me feel
All the things
That 
I have felt

Sometimes we endure pain in search of a reward
It is still, Not a sign of your own will

Knowledge I gather 
Is used in things i do
Sometimes it fails

I see hear feel taste and smell
Sometimes these all can make me feel good
But there are things that make me feel pain
Often so hard it makes me stay away
   
Sometimes i wonder
What are things that will make me act
I'm a slave to my mind
Just drifting along 

But what's the point
It's just the way I am 
I'll see the world
Until I die 



3. Embrace of faith

My truth is for all
And it makes me stand out
From the groups i see
Why cant i save them all from hell
Repent!

From goose egg
Bones of a giant
7 days to world
Made the goddess
Or was it god
Or a dozen
Shut your mouth
I'm preaching true knowledge

You suffer now
And i promise
After death
You're paid
Like your betters
Just follow me
And the others
We know best
We're blessed by the powers

I wish they had the faith that made them one of ours
But they are praying for the demons we must slay
Freeing them will prove that we can
Spread the truth

Kill the men
Rape their wives
Hang their boys
Slave their girls
When your done
You can see
God loves you
Praise!

I feel a sense of quilt from my deeds
I should let it go as there is nothing wrong that I have done
Just follow rules sanctified in our holy book
And you can cast aside all doubt

It bring my rage out
When they seem care free
Being happy is reserved for clergy
No peasant should enjoy their piety
I will cut them down
and bring them all
despair!

I heard a fairy tale that made me think of life
They claim to see the truth
What made me choose them when i can't
The demons that they preach about seem not so far apart
From their own teaching that i have followed all my life

From goose egg
Bones of a giant
7 days to world
Made the goddess
Or was it god
Or a dozen
Shut your mouth
I'm preaching true knowledge

You suffer now
And i promise
After death
You're paid
Like your betters
Just follow me
And the others
We know best
We're blessed by the powers

It tears my self apart
When they still think they're running things so well
It pains me
Drains me for days
Until i break down
And finally I rip my reins apart

Death
For all
Apostates!

4. No time to waste:

When you're born
Grow up fast
Learn some skills
And just obey

Do your job
Pay your tax        
Waste your life
Kneel down for me
 
Find a mate
Fuck them bare
Shape your kids
And break their will

When you're old
Locked in place
You did good
But just die soon

But life
It feels so good
If not 
There is pills for you
Just smile
Your dreams away
Be free
From thinking

When you're born
Grow up fast
Learn some skills
And just obey

Do your job
Pay your tax        
Waste your life
Kneel down for me   

Find a mate
Fuck them bare
Shape your kids
And break their will

When you're old
Locked in place
You did good
But just die soon

They say
They need me here
It means
They'r using me
No point
In pleasing them
I choose
My own way

I could
Bleed out
And die
right now
for no big change
But this
Is true for all
There's no
Exceptions


5. Gift of Life

Let
Me go
I'm in pain now
No health
Come and save me
No joy
I'm insane now

Pain
It hurts
I feel
I'm in pain now
Will Then
Come and save me
Be Gone
Just let me die

They keep me fed and juiced up until
There is nothing left of my former self

I
I see the truth
You also know it too
We are searching for a cure
That is not true
Mercy to pain
Saints are now torturers

It hurts so bad
It makes me mad
Just make it stop
I have served my time

Let
Me go
I'm in pain now
No health
Come and save me
No joy
I'm insane now

Pain
It hurts
I feel
I'm in pain now
Will Then
Come and save me
Be Gone
Just let me die

They keep me fed and juiced up until
There is nothing left of my former self

I
I see the truth
You also know it too
We are searching for a cure
That is not true
Mercy to pain
Saints are now torturers

It hurts so bad
It makes me mad
Just make it stop
I have served my time

Let
Me go
I'm in pain now
No health
Come and save me
No joy
I'm insane now

Pain
It hurts
I feel
I'm in pain now
Will Then
Come and save me
Be Gone
Just let me die


6. Eternal feast:
 
Now start the orgy
Roll in barrels of beer
Fill your lust 
For flesh and blood
Take more than you can ever use

No time to worry
It's for some other day
One more round 
For our fallen friends
I wish they all were here

Green forests with beautiful trees
They go up in flames 
Like victims of hate

These waters once pristine and sweet 
Now scream out in pain
And poison all else

Now start the orgy
Roll in barrels of wine
Fill your lust 
For flesh and blood
Take more 
Than you can ever use

No time to worry
It's for some other day
One more round 
For our fallen friends
I wish they all were here

I was blind for changes i see
Years of my life were just fleeting away
There are things 
That make me regret 
But where are people
Who should have warned

Ale that i drink turns to ash in my mouth
World is dying all around me
It's too late
To save all our lives 
But past is gone 
And feast must go on

Now start the orgy
Roll in barrels of booze
Fill your lust 
For flesh and blood
Take more 
Than you can ever use

No time to worry
It's for some other day
One more round 
For our fallen friends
I wish they all were here

I am starting to see where we end
Fighting for last bits of meat on our plates
Gone are days of infinite feast
Time runs short we fight to survive
 
Someone devours the seeds we had saved
Ripping the last chance for us to survive
Human flesh is all that remains
For the feast that
May be our
Can be our
Will be or
This is our
Funeral 


7. Dispersing energy:


We are a part
of energy
dispersing
out to fill the void.

World is warm.  
and the stars shine bright.

We feel strong
and full of life.            
 
We're looking forward in this world that is so bright 
There is all the time we need to change our fates.
Feeling so powerfull and wise, that there is absolutely nothing we can't do.

We are a part
of energy
dispersing
out to fill the void.

World moves on.
and the stars eat stars.

Some are lost.
But we go on.

Our strenght is fading but we can get it back.
Taking energy from other entities.
But we can see that there is a limit for our time.
and it makes it hard to choose what we will do.

heat death!
heat death!
heat death!
heat death!
heat death!
heat death!  
heat death!
death!

World is calm.
and it's get-ting dark.

All alone
I'll soon be gone

No interaction in this world without a light.
Meaning of time is soon lost for all that is.
Feeling so old and wise, 
when I know
there is absolutely nothing I can do.

heat death!
heat death!

We are a part

dispersing
out to fill the void
